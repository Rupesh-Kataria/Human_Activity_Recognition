# Human_Activity_Recognition

The function utilizes a CNN model to extract image features and an LSTM to identify sequential activities, effectively categorizing human activity in a given video. By breaking the video into evenly distributed frames and analyzing each frame, it identifies patterns and determines the ongoing activity. The trained model, consisting of LRCN and ConvLSTM, takes the video as input and classifies it into different categories
